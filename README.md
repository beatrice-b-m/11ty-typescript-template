# 11ty with ESM and TS/TSX

Template made for personal use. Heavily based on the repo https://github.com/pauleveritt/eleventy-tsx but with some small changes based on my preferences.

Files can be built with `npm run build` or deployed to a local dev server (with live-updates) with `npm run dev`. By default the entire `src/` directory is watched for updates to rebuild during development but this can be edited in the 11ty config (`eleventy.config.ts`).
